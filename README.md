# Introduction

This is a lightweight Redmine API client.

I wanted create something like TUI of Redmine, but when i dive into learning of TUI libs like bubbletea, i spent all my free time slots and this idea was on pause for a while...until once i needed
small lib to get all my time entries from redmine to build over this one some another cool TUI app.

So basically this lib, a Go module, used for scroll over all Redmine time entries.

Another functional will be added (maybe) later...
